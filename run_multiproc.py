'''
This script uses MULTIPROCESSING to run in parallel many trials of the same algorithm
on different environments with fixed random seed (seed = trial number).

Command
    python3 run_multiproc.py <ALG_NAME> <N_TRIALS> <ENV_LIST>

Example
    python3 run_multiproc.py 5 ddpg.ddpg Pendulum-v0 Swimmer-v2

Data is still saved as usual in `data-trial`, but instead of the current date and time,
the seed (= trial number) is used. For example, for the above run data will be saved in

data-trial/ddpg/Pendulum-v0/0.dat
data-trial/ddpg/Pendulum-v0/1.dat
...

WARNING!
The script will run ALL trials in parallel! If you run too many
trials/environments this may clog your computer. Alternatively, you can use
`Pool` but there may be problems using it with Tensorflow.
Another option is to use `run_joblib.py`, but it is usually slower.
